## Test Infrastructure Improvements

### 1. Comprehensive Test Runner (`test_runner.py`)

Created a unified test execution script that:
- Automatically discovers and runs all Python and Java tests
- Installs required dependencies
- Generates coverage reports
- Provides detailed test result summaries
- Supports selective test execution (Python-only, Java-only)
- Handles different test frameworks (pytest, unittest, gradle)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python3 test_runner.py

# Run only Python tests
python3 test_runner.py --python-only

# Run only Java tests  
python3 test_runner.py --java-only

# Skip dependency installation
python3 test_runner.py --skip-deps

# Skip coverage report generation
python3 test_runner.py --no-coverage
```

### 2. Enhanced Test Methodologies

#### Mocking and Stubbing
- Extensive use of `unittest.mock` for isolating units under test
- Mocking external dependencies (file system, linear regression, JSON parsing)
- Stubbing API responses for endpoint testing

#### Edge Case Testing
- Boundary value testing (zero, negative, maximum values)
- Error condition testing (empty data, invalid formats)
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Precision and floating-point edge cases

#### Data-Driven Testing
- Parameterized tests with multiple data sets
- Comprehensive input validation testing
- Various configuration scenario testing
