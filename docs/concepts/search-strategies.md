# Theodolite's Search Strategies

Theodolite measures [its metrics](metrics) by performing isolated experiments for different load intensities and provisioned resource amounts.
However, to determine a system's resource demand or load capacity or a good approximation of those, it is often not necessary to evaluate each possible combination. Instead, Theodolite provides search strategies, which decide at benchmark runtime which combinations of load and resources to evaluate.
